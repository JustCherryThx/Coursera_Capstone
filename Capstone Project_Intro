            "source": "There is currently a pandemic of a flu-like virus spreading across the globe that has caused panic amidst that worldwide population and has brought forward different flaws in the responses that we have available. The location data will be able to show where concentrations of individuals have been identified with confirmed cases of COVID-19, as well as will show the spread into a larger population. This collection will show how populations that have already been infected have quelled the spread of the virus versus where current known cases in MN and will hopefully assist with the least amount of infection being spread as possible. I almost want to compare it to fictional data to show the spread of a zombie virus but because this is an infection that seems to be targeting the respiratory system and travel through the air and regular contact versus a bite, it would be difficult to compare as airborne viruses spread more easily and we don't have set data on duration of transferrance of the virus until showing symptoms, etc.\n\nThis information would be available for lawmakers, health professionals, and the public to show what changes need to be made, or what policies are currently in place that work well, to have the best approach to health care - namely how preventive versus reactive responses aid in containment of the deadly virus. As of now there are confirmed cases that have been transmitted through both travel and through the community and data about the spread of the virus through Italy (as an outline of not containing the virus and affecting a large part of the population versus Hong Kong or Singapore, populations that have fairly effectively kept the amount of known cases to a minimum)."
